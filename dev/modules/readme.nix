      Apply changes to a flake input by importing its branch and using it as a Git submodule ü§Ø

      ## Background

      Sometimes, a project can be used as a flake input as-is,
      but often, we want to apply changes to it prior to consumption.
      [Nix does not yet provide a feature of seamless application of patches to flake inputs](https://github.com/NixOS/nix/issues/3920).
      This project defines a workflow for applying changes to an input
      by importing its branch into our repository
      and referring to that branch via path that points to a Git submodule.
      Commands that support this workflow are provided via
      [via flake-parts options](https://flake.parts/options/${projectName}.html).

      ## Benefits

      - üê¨ single-repo setup; more self-contained, less to keep track of

      - üíÉ no artificial committing/pushing during development

      - üï∫ no typing `--override-input` and no accidentally omitting it

      - ‚ö° provided scripts save time and improve consistency

      - üßö‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è optional shallow import extra useful for inputs with huge history such as Nixpkgs

      ## The setup

      1. ‚¨áÔ∏è _import the upstream branch_ into our project's own repository.
         For example, we can import the upstream `nixpkgs-unstable` branch as `inputs/main/nixpkgs` in our repository.
         Repositories with huge histories such as Nixpkgs should be fetched shallowly
         and imported into a single artificial commit.

      2. add our repository at that branch as a Git submodule to our repository üí°.
         For example, at the path `${baseDir}/nixpkgs`. Our `.gitmodules` will include:

         ```
         [submodule "${baseDir}/nixpkgs"]
           path = ${baseDir}/nixpkgs
           url = ./.
         ```

      3. point the input url to that path:

         ```nix
         inputs.nixpkgs.url = "./${baseDir}/nixpkgs";
         ```

      4. Declare `inputs.self.submodules = true`.
         Otherwise, referring to the flake via path (e.g. `nix build .`)
         would result in submodules being omitted.
         It seems that Nix does not support `.?submodules=true`.

      ## Constraints ü™¢

      ### Minimal Nix version üîñ

      ${lib.trim minimalNixVersionDocSnippet}

      ### Git fetching only üê¢

      Since submodules need to be fetched,
      the project can be fetched only as a Git repository.
      For example it cannot be referred to as `github:mightyiam/infra` (tarball fetching).
      It must referred to as `git+https://github.com/mightyiam/infra` or similar instead.

      ### The input must be `flake = true` ‚ùÑÔ∏è

      It seems that an input that is referred to
      by relative path inside the superproject (e.g. `./${baseDir}/nixpkgs`)
      and is a Git submodule and is `flake = false`
      ends up being equivalent to `self`, which would be incorrect.
      So input-branch inputs must be `flake = true` (which is the default).
      Also, a `flake.nix` must exist.

      ## Costs üí∏

      ### Git submodules overhead ü§π‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

      Just the usual overhead associated with Git submodules,
      such as `$ git submodule init` and `$ git submodule update`.

      ### Superproject must be dirty üßπ

      It seems that when the superproject state is clean,
      submodules that are referred to by path will be fetched via Git ü§ï.
      Workaround: `$ touch dirt; git add -N dirt`
      This was reported as [issue 13324](https://github.com/NixOS/nix/issues/13324).

      ### Forge push limits üö´

      Inputs with huge histories should be handled shallowly.
      Otherwise, one might (with Nixpkgs will) hit forge push limits such as
      [GitHub's](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/using-git/troubleshooting-the-2-gb-push-limit).
      But if you insist, this can typically be worked around by chunking.

      ### Input branches must be pushed ü´∏

      Since our project now depends on multiple branches,
      we must ensure that in addition to pushing the usual branch,
      we also push the input branch.

      ### Tools must consider foreign code üõ†Ô∏è

      Since we now have input code under `./${baseDir}`,
      we must consider this path in the usage of tools such as linters and formatters.

      ### NixOS issues and workarounds

      > [!IMPORTANT]
      > This workflow causes/surfaces the following issues with NixOS.
      > A NixOS module that mitigates these issues is provided
      > as `#modules.nixos.${nixosModuleAttr}`.

      #### Git metadata in NixOS derivations üè∑Ô∏è

      By default NixOS uses git metadata in some derivations.
      This may be useful under normal circumstances,
      but when Nixpkgs is a Git submodule that is referred to by path,
      then the git metadata is no longer of the Nixpkgs repository, but of the superproject.
      This unintended consequence also results in more frequent/noisy NixOS derivation change.

      The provided NixOS module disables the use of Git metadata;
      It removes the `nixos-version` command
      and replaces the Nixpkgs revision that is by default included in boot entry labels
      with `${noGitMetadataPlaceholder}`.

      #### `nixpkgs.flake.source`

      By default the NixOS option `nixpkgs.flake.source` is set to `self.outPath`.
      This may be useful under normal circumstances,
      but when Nixpkgs is a Git submodule that is referred to by path,
      it results in the supreproject being part of the NixOS derivation,
      which is unacceptable because _any edit_ would result in a NixOS system change.
      The provided NixOS module sets this option to `null`,
      which results in the removal of Nixkpgs from the system flake registry.
      If you want Nixpkgs in the system flake registry
      you may override this option to a path of your Nixpkgs submodule path
      (possibly `lib.mkForce ../${baseDir}/nixpkgs` or similar).

      ### Increase in repository size ü¶õ

      Importing of foreign branches results in storage of foreign objects,
      increasing repository size.
      This can be mitigated by importing shallowly.
    '';
in
{
  perSystem =
    { pkgs, ... }:
    {
      files.files = [
        {
          inherit path_;
          drv = pkgs.writeText "README.md" text;
        }
      ];
    };
}
